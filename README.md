## How to Execute Rumii

1. Ensure Flutter and Dart are properly installed on your system.

2. Clone a copy of this repository to your local device to the location of your choosing.

3. Open Visual Studio code, and cd to the location of the project folder.

4. Optional: Add a new Virtual Device from Android Studio Code to use as an Emulator. This will allow you to run the app from a virtual device, such as a Google Pixel! Once the device is added, you may go to the Command Palette in VS Code, search "Flutter: Select Device", and choose the device from there. It may take a moment for the device to boot (remember to power it on!).

6. Open a new terminal, and run the "flutter run" command. If you are running the app without an emulator, you will be prompted to choose a web browser at this time (your system browser is recommended).

7. Rumii should boot up momentarily :)
