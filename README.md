## How to Execute Rumii

1. Ensure Flutter, Dart, and Visual Studio Code are properly installed on your system.

2. Clone a copy of this repository to your local device to the location of your choosing.

3. Open Visual Studio code, and cd to the location of the root directory (rumii).

4. Open a new terminal, and run the "flutter run" command. This will resolve any dependency issues. You will be prompted to choose a web browser at this time (your system browser is recommended, e.g. press "1" for Windows on a Windows machine).

7. Rumii should boot up momentarily! :)
   -  Note: Rumii has a responsive interface suitable to different screen sizes, however we recommend condensing your browser to a mobile size for the best User Experience! (e.g. 25-30% as wide as your computer screen)
